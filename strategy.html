    <h1>TCJ Smart Volume Concept</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      This strategy is built for crypto trading. It is not built for forex or any market that does not have reliable volume information.
      Control Candle detection requires Force Index, and Force Index requires volume.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      TCJ Smart Volume Concept is a structural participation framework built on one principle: Markets move when real force steps in and takes control.
      It is not built on candle size. It is not built on pattern recognition. It is built on measurable dominance — confirmed by volume and Force Index — and validated through participation.
    </p>
    <p class="lead muted">The framework is composed of three core components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Control Candles (TCC &amp; SCC)</li>
      <li>Anchored Execution Value (AEV)</li>
      <li>Volume Delta Imbalance (VDI)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lead muted">Each component answers a structural question:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Who took control?</li>
      <li>Where is their average?</li>
      <li>Is participation still expanding?</li>
    </ul>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Core Components</h2>

      <h3>1. Control Candles (CC)</h3>
      <p>
        Control Candles are structurally significant candles that mark moments when real force shifts dominance.
        They are not defined by price size alone.
      </p>
      <p>A candle becomes a Control Candle when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Volume expands meaningfully</li>
        <li>Force Index shows strong directional pressure</li>
        <li>Aggressive participation clearly commits</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This combination signals that one side stepped in with conviction and established control.
        From that moment forward, the market has a structural reference point. Price will either respect that control or violate it.
      </p>

      <h3>Tactical vs Structural Control</h3>
      <p><strong>Tactical Control Candles (TCC)</strong><br/>TCCs represent localized dominance. They initiate movement within the broader structure and define short-term control shifts. They explain how moves begin.</p>
      <p><strong>Structural Control Candles (SCC)</strong><br/>SCCs represent broader regime transitions. They mark larger dominance shifts that shape swing structure and liquidity positioning. They explain how regimes evolve.</p>

      <h3>Control Candle Invalidation</h3>
      <p>
        Control is only valid while it is respected.
        A Control Candle is invalidated when price closes above it and below it.
        When both sides of the Control Candle are breached on closing basis, control is no longer intact.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that point, dominance has weakened or transferred.
        This keeps the framework objective. Control is not assumed. It must remain structurally respected.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Volume &amp; Force Index (Detection Engine)</h3>
      <p>Volume and Force Index sit at the core of identifying Control Candles. They reveal participation quality.</p>
      <p><strong>Volume</strong><br/>Volume measures capital activity. Expansion signals meaningful interaction. However, activity alone does not confirm control.</p>
      <p><strong>Force Index</strong><br/>Force Index measures directional pressure. It evaluates whether buyers or sellers are pressing with conviction relative to price movement. Elevated Force Index signals initiative — not just movement, but commitment.</p>
      <p>
        When strong volume aligns with high Force Index, real force has entered the market.
        This alignment defines control. Without participation expansion, large candles can be deceptive.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Anchored Execution Value (AEV)</h3>
      <p>
        When a Control Candle forms, value resets. AEV combines aggressive and execution VWAPs anchored to the Control Candle.
        Together, they represent the average price of the participants who took control.
      </p>
      <p>
        This becomes the structural reference. If price remains positioned relative to AEV, control remains valid.
        If price crosses and fails to hold relative to AEV, control weakens.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Control Candle identifies who took dominance. AEV measures whether that dominance is still defended.</strong></p>

      <h3>4. Volume Delta Imbalance (VDI)</h3>
      <p>
        VDI measures participation sustainability after control forms.
        Price can move without real commitment.
      </p>
      <p>VDI distinguishes between:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Movement supported by expanding imbalance</li>
        <li>Movement driven by churn which is volume without Open Interest expansion</li>
      </ul>
      <p>VDI answers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is participation increasing?</li>
        <li>Is dominance strengthening?</li>
        <li>Is continuation structurally supported?</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>VDI does not predict direction. It validates whether control has real backing.</strong></p>

      <h3>Structural Foundation</h3>
      <p>Control defines who initiated dominance.</p>
      <p>AEV defines the dominant side’s average.</p>
      <p>VDI validates whether participation sustains that dominance.</p>
      <p>
        Control can form. Control can weaken. Control can transfer.
        The framework remains aligned only with confirmed participation — not assumption.
