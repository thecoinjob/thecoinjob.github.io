    <h1>TCJ Smart Volume Concept</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      TCJ Smart Volume Concept is a structural participation framework built around measurable control.
      It is not based on price patterns alone. It is built on identifying when real force enters the market and verifying whether that force remains in control.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">Markets do not move because of shapes. They move because capital commits.</p>
    <p class="lead muted">The framework is built on three core components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Control Candles (TCC &amp; SCC)</li>
      <li>Anchored Execution Value (AEV)</li>
      <li>Volume Delta Imbalance (VDI)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lead muted">Each component answers a specific structural question:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Who took control?</li>
      <li>Where is their average?</li>
      <li>Is participation still expanding?</li>
    </ul>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Core Components</h2>

      <h3>1. Control Candles (CC)</h3>
      <p>
        Control Candles mark moments when real force shifts dominance. They are not defined by candle size.
        They are defined by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strong volume expansion</li>
        <li>Elevated Force Index</li>
        <li>Clear aggressive participation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This combination signals that one side stepped in with commitment and absorbed or overpowered the other.
        A Control Candle is not simply an area where price reacted. It is a measurable moment where participation proved decisive.
      </p>
      <p>
        From that moment forward, the market has a structural reference. Price will either respect that shift or violate it.
      </p>

      <h3>Tactical vs Structural Control</h3>
      <p>There are two classifications:</p>
      <p><strong>Tactical Control Candles (TCC)</strong><br/>TCCs represent localized control shifts. They are the ignition points where initiative appears and short-term dominance begins. They explain why movement starts.</p>
      <p><strong>Structural Control Candles (SCC)</strong><br/>SCCs represent broader regime shifts. They define larger structural transitions and become reference anchors for liquidity and directional bias. They explain why movement sustains or reverses structurally.</p>

      <h3>Why Control Candles Instead of Traditional Order Blocks?</h3>
      <p>
        Traditional order block models often define zones based on price structure or displacement.
        TCJ Smart Volume Concept defines control based on measurable participation.
      </p>
      <p>The difference is foundational:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Order blocks identify where price moved from.</li>
        <li>Control Candles identify where force entered and proved dominance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By grounding structural reference points in volume and Force Index, the framework prioritizes confirmed participation rather than inferred intent.
        This shifts analysis from pattern recognition to participation validation.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Volume &amp; Force Index (Detection Engine)</h3>
      <p>Volume and Force Index form the core of Control Candle identification.</p>
      <p><strong>Volume</strong><br/>Volume measures activity and capital flow. Expansion signals that something meaningful is happening. However, activity alone does not equal dominance.</p>
      <p><strong>Force Index</strong><br/>Force Index measures directional pressure. It evaluates whether buyers or sellers are pressing with conviction relative to price movement. High Force Index indicates initiative — not just movement, but commitment.</p>
      <p>
        When volume expansion aligns with elevated Force Index, it signals real force entering the market.
        This combination defines control.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Without participation expansion, structural interpretation becomes speculative.</strong></p>

      <h3>3. Anchored Execution Value (AEV)</h3>
      <p>
        When control forms, value resets. AEV combines aggressive and execution VWAPs anchored to the Control Candle.
        Together, they represent the average price of the dominant participants.
      </p>
      <p>
        This transforms a moment of force into a measurable structural reference.
      </p>
      <p>
        If price remains positioned relative to AEV, control remains intact.
        If price fails to hold relative to AEV, control weakens or transfers.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Control identifies who took dominance. AEV measures whether that dominance is still defended.</strong></p>

      <h3>4. Volume Delta Imbalance (VDI)</h3>
      <p>
        VDI measures participation sustainability. Price can displace without real commitment.
        VDI evaluates whether imbalance is expanding or fading.
      </p>
      <p>It distinguishes between:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Continuation supported by participation</li>
        <li>Movement driven by churn which is volume without Open Interest expansion</li>
      </ul>
      <p>VDI answers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is dominance strengthening?</li>
        <li>Is participation aligned?</li>
        <li>Is continuation structurally supported?</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>VDI does not forecast. It confirms whether structural conditions remain valid.</strong></p>

      <h3>Structural Differentiation</h3>
      <p>
        Many frameworks focus primarily on liquidity mapping or price pattern interpretation.
        TCJ Smart Volume Concept integrates:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Measurable control</li>
        <li>Anchored value</li>
        <li>Participation validation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Rather than relying on structure alone, it requires participation confirmation.
        Rather than assuming intent, it measures commitment.
      </p>
      <p><strong>This creates a framework grounded in observable capital flow rather than inferred narrative.</strong></p>

      <h3>Foundation of the Model</h3>
      <p>Control defines who initiated dominance.</p>
      <p>AEV defines the average of that dominance.</p>
      <p>VDI validates whether participation sustains it.</p>
      <p><strong>Together, they create a system rooted in participation quality. The objective is not prediction. The objective is alignment with real force.</strong></p>
