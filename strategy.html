    <h1>TCJ Smart Volume Concept</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      TCJ Smart Volume Concept is built on one principle: Markets move when real force steps in and takes control.
      It is not based on price size alone. It is based on participation quality — who committed capital, who absorbed pressure,
      and whether that control is still being respected.
    </p>
    <p class="lead muted">The framework is built from three core components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Control Candles (CC)</li>
      <li>Anchored Execution Value (AEV)</li>
      <li>Volume Delta Imbalance (VDI)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lead muted">Each component answers a different question about the market.</p>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Core Components</h2>

      <h3>1. Control Candles (CC)</h3>
      <p>
        Control Candles are important candles that appear when real force enters the market.
        They are not defined by large price movement alone.
      </p>
      <p>A Control Candle is identified by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strong volume</li>
        <li>High Force Index</li>
        <li>Clear evidence of aggressive participation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This tells you that capital did not just flow — it committed. These candles matter because they mark the moment control changed hands.
        From that point forward, the market has a reference level. Price will either respect that area or violate it.
      </p>
      <p><strong>A Control Candle shows you who took control. Without control, price movement is noise.</strong></p>

      <h3>2. Anchored Execution Value (AEV)</h3>
      <p>
        When a Control Candle forms, it naturally gives rise to an AEV.
        AEV combines aggressive and execution VWAPs anchored to the Control Candle.
        Together, they represent the average price of the participants who took control.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is critical. If price stays positioned relative to that AEV, it signals that the controlling side is still defending their average.
        If price crosses and fails to hold relative to AEV, it signals weakening control or a potential transfer of dominance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Control Candle shows who took control. AEV shows whether that control is still being respected.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          AEV is not a generic average. It is tied directly to real participation and commitment.
          It converts a moment of dominance into a measurable reference point.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <h3>3. Volume Delta Imbalance (VDI)</h3>
      <p>
        VDI measures participation strength after control is established. Price can move without real commitment.
        VDI distinguishes between movement driven by real imbalance and movement driven by thin liquidity or churn which is volume without Open Interest expansion.
      </p>
      <p>VDI evaluates whether buyers or sellers are actively pressing with force. It answers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is participation expanding?</li>
        <li>Is continuation supported by real imbalance?</li>
        <li>Is dominance strengthening or fading?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When VDI aligns with control and value positioning, continuation is structurally supported.
        When VDI weakens, flattens, or diverges, control becomes fragile.
      </p>
      <p><strong>VDI does not predict direction. It confirms whether control has real backing.</strong></p>

      <h3>How They Work Together</h3>
      <p>Control Candle identifies the moment force entered.</p>
      <p>AEV tracks whether that force is being defended.</p>
      <p>VDI measures whether participation continues to support that control.</p>
      <p>
        Together, they remove guessing. Instead of reacting to price movement, decisions are grounded in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Who took control</li>
        <li>Where their average is</li>
        <li>Whether participation still validates them</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>
          This framework replaces emotional interpretation with structural confirmation.
          It is not built to generate frequent trades.
          It is built to align with real market participation.
        </strong>
